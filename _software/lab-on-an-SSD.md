## Motivation

Nanopore sequencing and bioinformatics requires a set of specialised software. For real-time work
the analysis is best performed at the point of data generation. Nanopore sequencing benefits
greatly from the availability of graphical processor unit (GPU) enabled computers, paticularly
for basecalling. For this reason we provide a convenient solution, "lab-on-an-SSD", a software
image containing a full Linux operating system, GPU drivers, software for nanopore sequencing
and the ARTIC analysis pipeline (including RAMPART). This can be run on suitable laptops to
provide rapid sequencign answers without the need for large computing infrastructure or internet
connectivity.

## Installation

For further instructions and installation, refer to [the GitHub repository page](https://github.com/artic-network/lab-on-an-SSD).

## Status

Lab-on-an-SSD is in development with a publication forthcoming.
